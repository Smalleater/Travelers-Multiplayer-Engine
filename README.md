# Travelers Multiplayer Engine (TME)

---

## Overview

**TME (Travelers Multiplayer Engine)** is a cross-platform C++ network engine designed to simplify multiplayer game development.
It supports both Windows (via Winsock) and POSIX-compliant systems (via BSD sockets).

The current goal is to provide an optimized, lightweight, and easy-to-use engine capable of handling all basic networking operations — such as creating servers, connecting clients, sending packets, and more.

The ultimate goal is to develop TME into a fully featured network engine specifically tailored for multiplayer needs.
