# Travelers Netcode (TRA)
---
## Overview
**TRA (Travelers Netcode)** is a cross-platform C++ netcode designed to simplify multiplayer game development.
It supports both Windows (via Winsock) and POSIX-compliant systems (via BSD sockets).
The current goal is to provide an optimized, lightweight, and easy-to-use netcode capable of handling all basic networking operations — such as creating servers, connecting clients, sending packets, and more.
The ultimate goal is to develop TRA into a fully featured netcode specifically tailored for multiplayer needs.
